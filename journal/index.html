        From Oklama
    </h1>
    <p>
        I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
        <br>
        <br>
        I go months without a phone.
        <br>
        <br>
        Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.
        <br>
        <br>
        While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.
        <br>

        As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life’s calling.
        <br>
        <br>
        There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I’ve prayed for you all.
        <br>
        <br>
        See you soon enough.
