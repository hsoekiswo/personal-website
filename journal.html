                        I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I go months without a phone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life’s calling.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I’ve prayed for you all.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        See you soon enough.
                        <br>
