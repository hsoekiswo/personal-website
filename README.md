# About
This is my personal website inspired by [Kendrick Lamar](https://oklama.com/). This is my first web that I deployed on the web. The focus of this project is an exploration of basic HTML, CSS and Javascript through playful interaction with the goal to give a nostalgic nuance of my childhood.

# Detail
There are 
- About: brief description about me
- Contact: a portal to contact me through email or call book
- Portfolio: the list of my web projects (I'm still cooking, so currently not showing any link)
- Journal: some writing that I liked to share
- Music: recommended playlist for surfing the web
- Bookshelf: the books that I loved

# Tools
In this web I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Vercel. There's no framework used in this project.
